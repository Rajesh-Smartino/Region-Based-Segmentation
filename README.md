# Region-Based-Segmentation

The implementation is based on simple region growing technique to segment the region in the image. The code works for both color and gray scale image; adjusted accordingly to run properly. Report and Usermanual is attached as a help.

### Pre-requisite
- CV2: ```pip install opencv-python```
- Pylab: ```pip install pip install pylab-sdk```
(or)
- Matplotlib: ```pip install matplotlib```
- Numpy: ```pip install numpy```
- Math: pre-installed in python else use ```pip install python-math```


### Useage
```python region_growing.py```

### What's In?
- region_growing.py: The code.
- Report.pdf: Report containing theory and results.
- Usermanual.pdf: A guide tour for user interface and how to use code.
- input1.jpeg, input2.png: To test codes either for color or grayscale
- Input images folder: contains many test inputs
- Output images folder: obtained results
- mainUI.py: The User interface code
